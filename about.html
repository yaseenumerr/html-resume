<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Iam Yaseen Umer. I have a ug in BCA from Presidency University and presenty i am trying to expertise web development
  from my home. I have stayed in Bangalore for 18 months in Yelahanka Rajankunte area which is were the collage is. I think 
  the degree has given me some basic knowledge about what fields you can hop on to after getting a BCA degree. 
</p>

<p>There are lots of fields inside Computer Science. Some are web dev, ethical hacking, network, Operating Systems, Software engineering,
  Software testing, data structures and algorithms, graphics, game development etc. But the one iam interested in and i want to persue is 
  web development with MERN stack. 
</p>

<p>There is like 5 months till i will be asked to join Indegene, the company which i got placed. And in the mean time i am learning more about
  web development everyday. So yeah that is about me.
